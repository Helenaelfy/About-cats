         <h3>British Shorthair</h3>
         <p>
            According to one version, it is descended from the Chartreux breed, and according to another, from Roman cats and local 
            relatives. The fur of the British cat is very fluffy and soft but quite short. British cats come in various colors: 
            blue-gray, blue, black, lilac, chocolate. The head is round with well-developed cheeks, broad at the cheeks. The neck is
            short and thick. The nose is short, wide, straight. In profile, the round forehead transitions to a short, straight nose. 
            The ears are small, rounded, set low and wide. The eyes are large, round, wide open, and widely set. They are usually bright
             orange in color. Pointed cats have blue eyes. Chinchillas can have fur colors ranging from blue, lavender to emerald green. 
             The body is low-set, with a straight, short back. The chest is wide. Shoulders are broad and massive. Legs are short, thick, 
             with round, strong, dense paws. The tail is thick, of medium length, rounded at the end, and wide at the base.

         <h3>Canadian Sphynx</h3>
         <p>
            One of the several hairless cat breeds, the reason for the ancestors of this breed losing their fur, as with all other 
            Sphinx breeds, remains unclear. It is most likely associated with isolated natural mutations, which were subsequently 
            supported and preserved through selective breeding. Nowadays, offspring of hairless parents are also born without fur, 
            although it can be present in varying amounts on their faces and tails. Sphynx cats are very affectionate and intelligent,
            but their behavior is still influenced by human upbringing. They are easily trainable and have good memories. Sphynx cats
             are agile jumpers; even adolescent cats of this breed can jump to a height of up to one meter, while adults can reach up to 
             1.3 meters. Cats of this breed don't tolerate loneliness and are usually very attached to their owners. Canadian Sphynx cats
            are of medium size, fairly robust, and not fragile. Like most other cat breeds, adult males are larger than females. Sphynx 
            cats have sturdy bones, well-developed muscles, and a firm abdomen, as if they've just eaten. They have open eyes and 
            intelligent facial expressions. The wrinkles on their heads, to some, may give them a worried, inquisitive look. Sphynx cats
             are extremely sweet, very sociable, and in their attempts to attract attention, they may perform various, albeit sometimes
             clumsy, tricks. They possess a lot of energy and can be mischievous, always wanting to be near their owner or at least in 
             their sight. Sphynx cats enjoy human attention but can also relish the company of dogs and other cats.

         <h3>American Shorthair</h3>
         <p>
            The American Shorthair is a domestic cat breed that originated from European cats brought to North America by early settlers 
            to protect valuable cargo from mice and rats. These cats do not require special care and are typically healthy, calm, 
            affectionate with their owners, and sociable with strangers. Males are significantly larger than females and can weigh 
            between 11 to 15 pounds when fully grown. Mature females weigh between six to twelve pounds, achieving their full size at 
            the age of three to four years. With a high-quality diet and plenty of love and care, they can live 15 years or more, 
            requiring annual vaccinations and veterinary check-ups.These cats have sturdy, powerful, and muscular bodies with 
            well-developed shoulders, chests, and hind legs. The American Shorthair comes in more than eighty different colors and 
            patterns, ranging from brown-spotted tabby cats to blue-eyed whites, silver shades, smokes, and many other colors.

         <h3>Exotic Shorthair</h3>
         <p>
            Exotics closely resemble Persian cats in appearance. They are stocky, robust, and compact cats with a large round head, 
            big round expressive eyes, pronounced cheeks, small forward-facing ears, a short snub nose with a well-defined stop, and 
            a somewhat "babyish" look. Exotics are sometimes referred to as "lazy man's Persian" because they closely resemble Persians 
            but do not require extensive grooming due to their short, dense, and plush-like fur, which is about two centimeters long. 
            Today, the Exotic Shorthair, thanks to its distinctive appearance and calm temperament, is a highly popular breed worldwide. 
            Exotics come in a wide variety of colors, ranging from white to blue-black. They can have solid colors, bicolor patterns, 
            and you can often find tri-color patterns such as red tabby, marble, tortoiseshell, and more.

         <h3>Abyssinian</h3>
         <p>
            The Abyssinian cat is a vibrant feline with distinct ticking on its fur, of medium size and a regal appearance. It is a 
            flexible, sturdy, and muscular cat that shows impulsive activity and keen interest in everything around it. The Abyssinian 
            has a balanced temperament and good physical balance. The head has the shape of a slightly modified wedge, with no flat 
            planes; the brows, cheeks, and profile are softly contoured. The muzzle is not pointed or square. An exception should be 
            made for adult males with a prominent chin. The ears are alert, large, moderately pointed, cupped, and wide at the base, 
            as if the cat is listening attentively to something. The eyes are almond-shaped, large, bright, and expressive, not round or
            oriental, with a dark line accentuated by a light area. The legs and paws are proportionally slender and graceful, giving 
            the Abyssinian a floating appearance, barely touching the ground with the tips of its toes. The paws are oval, small, and 
            compact, with five toes on the front feet and four on the back. The tail is thick at the base, fairly long, tapering towards 
            the end. The fur is soft, silky, fine-textured, yet dense and resilient to the touch, with a bright sheen. It is of medium 
            length.

         <h3>Maine Coon</h3>
         <p>
            The Maine Coon is the largest breed of cats, with males weighing between 5.9 to 8.2 kg (13 to 18 pounds) and females 
            weighing between 3.6 to 5.4 kg (8 to 12 pounds). The height at the withers in adult cats ranges from 25 to 41 cm 
            (10 to 16 inches), and the total length, including the tail, can reach up to 120 cm (47 inches). The full potential size 
            of a Maine Coon is typically achieved between the ages of 3 to 5 years. All Maine Coons have small tufts on the tips of their
            ears. The body length of Maine Coons can be a meter or more, with the longest officially registered Maine Coon having a body 
            length of 1 meter 23 centimeters. Maine Coons have long fur that is soft and silky, with texture variations depending on the 
            fur color and breed type. The fur on the head and shoulders is shorter, while it's longer on the abdomen and sides. Some 
            males may even develop a decorative ruff around their neck. Maine Coon fur undergoes seasonal changes, with it being lighter 
            and shorter in the summer and slightly longer with a more developed and dense undercoat in the winter.
