             <p><strong>How to prepare for a cat to feel comfortable in your home:</strong></p>
             <p>
                Provide a comfortable sleeping area, preferably somewhere elevated, in a safe and draft-free location. A litter box and 
                a scoop for their toilet needs. Cats must have access to clean water. You will need a small food dish, placed at a 
                sufficient distance from the water bowl to prevent it from getting dirty. A scratching post. You probably won't 
                appreciate the scratches your cat might leave on your furniture or walls. Nevertheless, it's a natural behavior for a 
                cat, so it's important to provide them with specific places to sharpen their claws. A play area where they can climb and 
                hide.
            </p>
            <p><strong>The surrounding environment is crucial for a cat's health and well-being.</strong></p>
            <p>
                If it's favorable, a cat will adapt to a new place more quickly. Here are some guidelines for creating a cat-friendly environment.
                <br>Feeding Area: Set up a designated feeding area in a quiet place, away from the litter box and the area where you eat.
                <br>Resting Area: Cats prefer sleeping in high places and will choose their resting spots based on sunlight and warmth 
                sources. Ensure your home has enough free corners for your pet to pick their favorite resting place.
                <br>Sanitary Zone: Place the litter box in a quiet and easily accessible location, away from their food bowl and areas 
                with high human traffic. It's recommended to provide at least one litter box for each cat and consider an additional 
                one to offer choices, which can help maintain cleanliness.
                <br> Play Area: The play area is essential and serves as a resting place for your cat. Installing a cat tree or complex 
                in this area promotes physical activity, keeping your cat healthy and happy.
                <br>By creating these designated zones within your home, you're contributing to a cat's well-being and helping them feel 
                comfortable and secure in their new environment.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Physical Activity</strong></p>
            <p>
                Cats that are kept indoors require regular physical activity. This not only helps maintain their physical fitness but 
                also stimulates their mental functions. Provide toys and a place for them to climb and hide to keep them engaged and 
                active.
            </p>
             <p><strong>Feeding.</strong></p>
             <p>
                Only high-quality cat food specially designed for cats can guarantee that they receive all the necessary nutrients 
                to maintain their health, regardless of their age, breed, lifestyle, or health characteristics. Frequent and constant 
                changes in a cat's diet can have a negative impact on their digestion. Cats have a high need for protein, including 
                essential amino acids, one of which is taurine, found only in animal-based products. Fats are an important source of 
                energy for cats. They also require vitamins and minerals, such as vitamin D, which they can only obtain from their food.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Coat Care</strong></p>
            <p>
                In addition to the aesthetic benefits of well-groomed and brushed fur, it also reduces the number of loose hairs that 
                a cat might ingest during self-grooming. These loose hairs can end up in the cat's digestive system, potentially leading 
                to hairballs and digestive issues. Cats with longer fur, such as Persians, require daily and thorough brushing. For 
                short-haired and smooth-coated cats like Siamese or Abyssinians, occasionally running your hand firmly along their fur 
                may be sufficient. Cats with medium-length or dense undercoats, like Maine Coons or Exotic Shorthairs, should be brushed 
                with a soft brush at least once a week.
            </p>
           <p><strong>Health.</strong></p>
           <p>
            Cats are vaccinated against panleukopenia virus, herpesvirus, and calicivirus. The vaccination schedule typically includes 
            two injections given 3-4 weeks apart, starting at around nine weeks of age. It's important to administer preventive 
            treatments for fleas, ticks, and worms. To prevent the development of diseases and keep track of your pet's weight and 
            behavior changes, it's essential to visit your veterinarian every year.
            </p>
             <p><strong>Training.</strong></p>
             <p>
                A significant portion of a kitten's training occurs during the first six months of life. The foundation of a cat's 
                behavior is established during the first three months of life, thanks to interactions with their mother and other 
                kittens.
